# Stein variational samplers
This repository contains MATLAB and python code for several Stein variational sampling algorithms. 

### MATLAB
The directory "MATLAB" contains the test cases implemented in "A Stein variational Newton method" (SVN), https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03085.pdf (Detommaso et al., NIPS 2018).

### python
The directory "python" contains the following items.
- The directory "SVN". This provides an easy-to-use iPython application of SVN to some low-dimensional test cases.

- The directory "SVOCD". This provides code for the test cases implemented in "Stein Variational Online Changepoint Detection with Applications to Hawkes Processes and Neural Networks" [ref].
