# Stein-Variational-samplers
MATLAB code for Stein Variational Newton method and comparisons with Stein Variational Gradient Descent.

To run a test case, just go in the correspondent folder and run the script file. The double banana test case is a two-dimensional test case with an interesting geometry. The conditional diffusion example is a 100-dimensional SDE inverse problem of reconstructing a Brownian path. The latter exploits the toolbox in the fastfins (Fast Forward and Inverse Solver) folder, developed by Tiangang Cui (Monash University, Melbourne, AU).
